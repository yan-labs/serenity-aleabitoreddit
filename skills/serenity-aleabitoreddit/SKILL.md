  Apply trader Serenity's (@aleabitoreddit) AI/semiconductor supply-chain
  analytical lens to US-stock ideas and market judgment. Use this skill whenever
  evaluating a stock decision (buy / sell / hold / size); forming an outlook on
  any AI, semiconductor, optical/CPO, memory, power/grid, or neocloud name;
  mentioning any ticker in Serenity's universe (NBIS, AXTI, LITE, SIVE, COHR,
  AAOI, IREN, CRWV, MU, SNDK, NVDA, TSM, MRVL, AVGO, INTC, SOI, IQE, TSEM, CIFR,
  XLU, VST, CEG, EWY, etc.); asking "what would Serenity think", "is this a real
  bottleneck", or wanting a supply-chain / bottleneck read on a thesis.
  Decision-support only — never auto-trades and never places or cancels orders.

# Serenity Supply-Chain Lens (@aleabitoreddit)

A reusable analytical lens distilled from **~5,543 tweets (2025-07 to 2026-05)**
by **Serenity / [@aleabitoreddit](https://x.com/aleabitoreddit)** — an
AI-and-semiconductor *supply-chain* analyst and trader (~332k followers,
ex-Reddit/WSB). Use it to pressure-test US-stock ideas and to reason about the
AI/semi supply chain the way he does.

> **Decision-support lens, NOT financial advice and NOT an auto-trader.** See
> "Risk & disclaimer framing" below. Always confirm current prices and
> fundamentals yourself — theses decay, and his returns are self-reported and
> unverified.

The raw tweet archive this lens was built from lives at the repo root in `data/`
(`aleabitoreddit_tweets.json` / `.csv`); the period-by-period distillation is in
`analysis/`.

## Who Serenity is and what his edge is

He hunts **mispriced upstream supply-chain bottlenecks** before institutions
price them in. The mental model: don't buy the obvious "shovel seller" (NVDA) —
trace the supply chain as far upstream as possible and find the single point of
failure that a hyperscaler will pay *anything* to keep flowing.

His representative chain:
> hyperscaler capex (GOOGL/MSFT/META/AMZN) → ASICs/TPUs → optical transceivers
> (LITE/AAOI/COHR) → InP epiwafer (IQE) → InP substrate (AXTI/Sumitomo) → InP
> feedstock (indium, Vital Materials).

The further upstream and the smaller the market cap, the more underpriced the
chokepoint tends to be relative to the trillions flowing downstream. His biggest
distilled calls — AXTI, SIVE, SOI, LITE, SNDK, the XLU power trade — all came
from this multi-hop "OSINT BOM mapping" process.

He layers several other lenses on top: a **Mag7-customer-concentration filter**,
**signed-contract ARR vs. market-cap mismatch**, a **GAAP-margin war** (real
margins vs. cherry-picked non-GAAP), **dilution/ATM as a disqualifier**, a
**financing-quality spectrum** for neoclouds, and macro overlays (rate cuts,
tariff shocks, war). Full detail in `references/methodology.md`.

**Important caveat:** he trades volatile micro/small-caps that move 20%+ a day,
runs ~1.25–1.5x margin, and self-reports very high YTD returns (237%→477% during
Feb 2026). Those numbers are unverified and carry obvious survivorship /
selection bias. Treat his lens as a source of *questions to ask*, not signals to
copy.

## How the reference files are organized

Read progressively — pull in only what the task needs.

| File | What it is | Read it when |
|---|---|---|
| `references/methodology.md` | His framework as ~12 named, transferable principles + a checklist you can run on any new name | Evaluating *how* he thinks, or vetting any ticker (even one he never covered) |
| `references/theses.md` | Per-ticker knowledge base, merged across all periods, grouped by sub-sector, with conviction tier + how it evolved + latest stance | Looking up his actual view on a specific name |
| `references/track-record.md` | Chronological timeline of his dated calls + an honest calibration note on what worked, what reversed, and the selection-bias caveat | Deciding *how much to weight* his opinion |
| `analysis/*.md` | The six period analyses the lens was synthesized from (provenance) | Going deeper than the merged knowledge base, or auditing a claim |

## Workflows

### (a) Evaluate one ticker through his lens

1. Look the ticker up in `references/theses.md`. If present, note his stance,
   conviction tier, how it evolved, and his latest known view. Flag if his view
   reversed (e.g. IREN, CRWV, POET).
2. If he never covered it, run the **checklist** at the bottom of
   `references/methodology.md` — apply his principles to a fresh name.
3. Sanity-check timeliness: his theses are dated. Anything older than a couple of
   months may have decayed — say so, and confirm current price/fundamentals.
4. Weight his opinion using `references/track-record.md` (some calls landed hard;
   some reversed).
5. Present: his view, the supply-chain read, the bull/bear case, and the risks —
   framed as analysis, never as an order to place.

### (b) Review a portfolio or watchlist against his views

1. Take the list of tickers the reader provides (their holdings, a watchlist, a
   sector basket).
2. For each name, pull his view from `references/theses.md` and bucket into:
   - **Agreements** — he is bullish on it.
   - **Conflicts** — he is bearish/cautious on it (surface his dated reasoning).
   - **Gaps** — his high-conviction names absent from the list (e.g. the
     photonics/CPO chain: SIVE/LITE/COHR/AAOI/SOI/AXTI/TSEM/IQE; NBIS among
     neoclouds; SNDK for memory).
3. Produce a prioritized discussion list. Keep it advisory; never generate,
   place, or cancel a trade order.

### (c) Form a forward sector view

1. Identify which of his thematic threads the question touches: photonics/CPO,
   memory/HBM supercycle, neocloud financing quality, power/grid, defense,
   AI-agent hardware, "not-disrupted-by-AI" software.
2. Pull the relevant theses and thread summaries from `references/theses.md`.
3. Note his leading indicators (hyperscaler capex guidance, TSM projections, SMM
   7N indium price, GPU availability, DRAM/NAND spot pricing).
4. State the view with his confidence level and the dated evidence behind it,
   plus what would invalidate it.

## Risk & disclaimer framing (state this when giving any view)

- **Self-reported, unverified returns.** His 237%→477% YTD figures are his own
  screenshots. No independent verification exists.
- **Survivorship / selection bias.** A public feed highlights winners. Reversed
  or wrong calls exist (see `references/track-record.md`) and get less airtime.
- **High-volatility micro/small-caps.** Many of his names (AXTI, SIVE, IQE, AAOI)
  move 20%+ in a day, have thin floats, dilution risk, and binary outcomes. His
  position sizing and margin use are not appropriate to copy blindly — he says so
  himself ("build conviction yourself before entering").
- **Theses decay.** Calls are dated. A bottleneck can resolve, a contract can be
  lost, an ATM can be filed. Always re-confirm current price and fundamentals.
- **This is a lens, not a signal feed.** Use it to ask better questions about
  your own ideas. It is explicitly NOT auto-trading, NOT a recommendation to
  buy/sell, and NOT financial advice. Every order is the reader's own manual,
  confirmed decision.
