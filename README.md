# serenity-aleabitoreddit

[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/yan-labs/serenity-aleabitoreddit)](https://skills.sh/yan-labs/serenity-aleabitoreddit)

Everything distilled from **Serenity
([@aleabitoreddit](https://x.com/aleabitoreddit))** — a public X trader and
AI/semiconductor *supply-chain* analyst known for tracing hyperscaler capex into
upstream bottlenecks. His recurring research terrain includes optical/CPO and
photonics, InP substrates and compound semis, memory/HBM/NAND, neocloud
financing quality, AI power/grid demand, robotics/physical AI, and overlooked
international supply-chain names.

This repo packages his public work into one self-contained research artifact:
**the raw tweet archive**, **long-form article summaries**, a
**period-by-period distillation**, and a ready-to-use **agent skill** that
applies his analytical lens to US-stock ideas.

Built from **6,745 tweets** spanning **2025-07-02 → 2026-10-26** plus **4 X
Articles** published in **2026-01 → 2026-05**.

> ⚠️ **Not financial advice. Decision-support only.** This skill never trades and
> never places or cancels orders. Serenity's self-reported returns are unverified
> and carry obvious survivorship/selection bias; his names are volatile
> micro/small-caps. Use the lens to ask better questions, not to copy trades.

## What's in here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `serenity-aleabitoreddit/SKILL.md` | The agent skill: who he is, his edge, the three workflows, risk framing |
| `serenity-aleabitoreddit/references/methodology.md` | His framework as ~12 named, transferable principles + a checklist for any new name |
| `serenity-aleabitoreddit/references/theses.md` | Per-ticker knowledge base, merged across all periods, grouped by sub-sector, with conviction tiers and how each evolved |
| `serenity-aleabitoreddit/references/articles.md` | Compact summaries and portfolio-use rules for Serenity's long-form X Articles; full article text is intentionally not stored |
| `serenity-aleabitoreddit/references/track-record.md` | Chronological timeline of his dated calls + an honest calibration note |
| `serenity-aleabitoreddit/references/maintenance.md` | Maintenance rules for incrementally distilling new posts into the skill |
| `serenity-aleabitoreddit/analysis/*.md` | The six period analyses the skill was synthesized from (provenance) |
| `data/aleabitoreddit_tweets.json` | Full tweet archive, all fields (text, metrics, quoted tweets, media, timestamps) |
| `data/aleabitoreddit_tweets.csv` | Same archive as a spreadsheet (id, url, time, text, likes, views, etc.) |
| `data/ticker_stats.txt` | His `$ticker` universe by mention count + first/last seen |
| `assets/serenity-avatar.jpg` | Local copy of Serenity's public X avatar used in this README |
| `prep.py` | Condenses the tweet JSON into monthly chunks and recomputes the ticker stats |
| `update.py` / `scripts/ingest_x_posts.py` | Primary: merge an X API / Grok Bot connector dump via `--from-json` (thin alias: `scripts/ingest_x_posts.py`); dedupes by id, prints `NEW`/`NEW_IDS`, refreshes CSV + ticker stats. Optional offline live pull uses the public x.com profile / Jina fallback. Steps: `scripts/GROK_SYNC.md` |

## Use it as a skill

One-command install with [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/):

```bash
npx skills add yan-labs/serenity-aleabitoreddit
```

Or drop the folder into an agent's skills directory:

```bash
# Claude Code (project-local)
cp -r serenity-aleabitoreddit <your-project>/.agents/skills/
ln -s ../../.agents/skills/serenity-aleabitoreddit <your-project>/.claude/skills/serenity-aleabitoreddit
```

It then triggers on questions about AI/semiconductor/optical/memory/power/
neocloud names, supply-chain bottleneck analysis, or evaluating a stock idea.

## His edge, in one line

Don't buy the obvious shovel-seller (NVDA) — trace the supply chain upstream to
the single chokepoint a hyperscaler will pay anything to keep flowing
(optical/CPO, compound-semi substrates, memory, power), where the small market
cap is most mispriced relative to the trillions flowing downstream.

## How to read fresh posts

A 2026-06-11 post-to-market review added one practical rule: Serenity's best
supply-chain posts are usually not clean 1-day copy-trade signals. The more
repeatable pattern is **5-60 trading days** from public thesis to validation as
orders, filings, media coverage, institutional ownership, or local-market
attention catch up.

Use four buckets before treating a post as actionable:

| Post type | How to use it |
|---|---|
| New bottleneck thesis | Highest research weight when the dependency is fresh, underpriced, and backed by customer, capacity, policy, or filing evidence |
| Reaffirmation / buy-the-dip | Useful when a high-conviction name sells off on a false report, mechanical selloff, ATM overhang, or misunderstood earnings |
| Supplier map / watchlist / no-position idea | Research input only; build a watchlist and wait for company-specific evidence |
| Victory lap / mainstream validation | Confirms an older thesis worked; often late-cycle unless valuation and positioning reset |

Always separate the stock thesis from the market window. A strong Serenity idea
inside weak breadth or narrow sector participation is a selective/left-side
window, not a green light to chase near-price entries.

## Provenance

Ongoing archive updates are run by **Grok Bot**: the X connector / API pulls
@aleabitoreddit posts, `python3 scripts/ingest_x_posts.py <dump>` (or
`update.py --from-json`) merges them into `data/`, and the bot distills durable
signals into `references/` then pushes. See `scripts/GROK_SYNC.md`.
Unattended refresh is a Grok Bot routine (morning and evening), not CI.

`python3 update.py` without `--from-json` can still pull a short recent window
from the public `x.com/<user>` profile / Jina status pages for offline use —
not the supported unattended path. X Article bodies were fetched with
authenticated article access and distilled into summaries only; full article
text is not redistributed here. Prefer `--from-json` dumps that include
`note_tweet.text` so long posts are not truncated. Regenerate condensed monthly
chunks and ticker stats with `python3 prep.py`.
